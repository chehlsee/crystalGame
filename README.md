# unit-4-game
# Crystal Counter
# jQuery Assignment

### Description

In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library. 

### Installation

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `unit-4-game`, then clone it to your computer.

### How the Game Works

* There will be four different colored crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
* Each time the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
* The player only wins if their total score matched the random number that was given in the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* The game will restart whenever the player wins/loses.
* The app shows the number of games the player wins or loses. 

 Refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
